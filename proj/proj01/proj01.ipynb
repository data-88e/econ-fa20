    "Why do these curves look different than the normal linear supply and demand curves in the textbook? It's because in the textbook we've made a vastly simplifying assumptions that supply and demand curves are linear in nature. This would imply that, no matter at what price, a price decrease by \\\\$1 would change the amount supplied or demanded by the same amount. \n",
    "\n",
    "Is this intuitively true? Probably not. For example, a \\\\$1 decrease from \\\\$100 is trivial compared to a \\\\$1 decrease from an original price of \\\\$2. As humans, we think about changes as proportions, and this fact should be reflected in the supply and demand curves. What this implies is that these curves should be exponential in nature: at higher prices, a larger change in price will yield the same change quantity as compared to that in lower prices. \n",

    "As a popular alternative to hotels, Airbnb has become subject to occupancy taxes in cities around the world. These taxes are applied to short term lodgings and are typically enforced by local or state governments in the United States. Proponents of the tax argue that existing rules that apply to hotels should also be enforced for Airbnb. Opponents instead argue that these laws do not apply to services created out of excess capacity, and the tax would stifle innovation and growth in the industry<sup>2</sup>.\n",

    "In the week following Christmas in 2018, Massachussetts governor Charlie Baker signed into law *An Act Regulating and Insuring Short-Term Rentals*, which formalized existing short-term rental activity, mandating hosts to register with the state and to provide insurance for their listings. The law further extended the state’s existing room occupancy excise tax to short term rental bookings, imposing a 5.7% statewide excise on all reservations beginning July 1st 2019, in addition to a local option excise ranging from 0 to 6.5% and a convention center finance fee of 2.75\\% that only applied in select Massachusetts cities to finance the construction of convention centers statewide.\n",

    "In Boston, the total occupancy tax amount for Airbnb listings set forth by the act was 14.95%. This included a 5.7% statewide excise tax, a 6.5% local option excise, and a 2.75\\% convention center finance fee.  Immediately after the introduction of the tax, Airbnb worked with the state and local governments to help remit the tax on behalf of hosts. Figure 1 details the cost breakdown guests see when booking a listing on Airbnb's website, including the tax. Before the COVID-19 pandemic, Airbnb was expected to collect \\$27.5 million in fiscal year 2020 due to the tax on behalf of the state<sup>3</sup>. \n",
