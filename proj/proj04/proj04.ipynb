In this project we'll attempt to repeat the procedure De Bondt and Thaler use to show that people tend to \"overreact\" to sudden and dramatic news events, and that these overreactions are evident in stock prices. We'll may deviate from their procedure in certain spots, and we'll examine how this affects the conclusions we come to. Throughout this project not only will you be developing your data science skills and performing economics research similar to De Bondt and Thaler's, but you will also be prompted to think about the idea of reproducibility in economics and data science.

Provided to you is data on every stock tracked by GFD that is or has ever been traded on the New York Stock Exchange. Specifically, we have **closing** data, which is simply the last price the stock traded at on a particular day. The granularity of this data is monthly, meaning for each stock we have the closing price on the **last trading day of each month**. Additionally, we may also have the closing price on the **first** trading day of each month, although for some older stocks this beginning-of-the-month data is unavailable, so we will be using the end-of-month data."

First, De Bondt and Thaler used data from CRSP, whereas we used GFD data. If the two sources have differing data, naturally our results may differ. Additionally, we will use end-of-month closing price for monthly stock data, whereas De Bondt and Thaler may have measured monthly stock prices in a different way. If there is some trend that stock prices follow on specific days of the month, our results might reflect this trend. For example, it might be the case that more people than usual trade stocks on the last day of the month, in which case our end-of-month data might not be representative of how the stock did that month overall."

Doing so naturally divides the price of each share by whatever the split ratio was, since the overall value of the company hasn't changed, the only thing that changed is what proportion of a company a single share is worth.
